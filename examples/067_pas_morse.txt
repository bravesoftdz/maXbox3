{write a program that encodes a message into morse code and decode a message from morse code into english.the message should be located in the input file ,read the message in and from it determine which type of operation needs to be performed.write the result to the output file. enter the morse code using another input file.assume the message will be less then 1000 charactors,that a space occurs between patterns,and that the message contains only letters.
:Morse code must be typed in using '.' for a dot and '-' for a dash. Letters have to be separated by spaces and words have to be separated by '/'.

e.g. for "SOS SOS" type "... --- ... / ... --- ...".

you will probly have to store all the codes onto a file and use a serch function to call them! then output it on the screen and say if its correct! I dont have any code coz never done it! hope you enjoy and hope this is helpful!
