The fourth step is to "sort the list".  What does that mean?  Well, later in the same article I presented a more refined outline of the program which included a procedure entitled "SortList".  In it we asked the user about how they wanted the data sorted and then called PleaseWait.  The next line of code read "{ code to sort the list }".  Not much help there.  So this is the topic for today: Sorting.
You can sort anything that's in a list.  There are many ways to represent a list: an array, a chain of pointers, an instance of Delphi's TStringList object.  For the purposes of this discussion and demonstration, we'll be considering the conventional one-dimensional array.  There are several well known and well established ways to sort data.  We'll look at two of them.  First, the easy-to-understand but slow way: the Swap Sort.  Second is the harder-to-understand but fast way: the QuickSort.
