    {StartupInfo provides additional parameters to CreateProcess.
    I suspect that it is only safe to pass WriteHandle as hStdOutput
    because we are going to make sure that the child inherits it.
    This is not documented anywhere, but I am reasonably sure it is
    correct. It is (mildly) interesting to note that the example
    given in Win32.hlp "Creating a Child process with redirected
    input and output" does not set the 'StdHandle' fields of StartupInfo.
    Instead the parent process sets its own StdInput and StdOutput
    handles prior to creating the child process - Apparently, the child
    process will then use these values. It all seems a bit odd to me,
    given that a much simpler mechanism (Handle fields of StartupInfo)
    seems to have been provided. Anyway, this alternative approach does
    not seem to work when the parent process is GUI-based. Perhaps Windows
    ignores SetStdHandle for a GUI app.

    We should not have to use STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW and
    wShowWindow:= SW_HIDE as we are going to tell CreateProcess not to
    bother with an output window, but it would appear that Windows 95
    ignores the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag. Fair enough - it is not in the SDK
    documentation (I got it out of Richter). CREATE_NO_WINDOW actually makes
    virtually no difference to the execution time of my 'hello world' test
    program, but it seems the correct thing to do.

    I shouldn't bother with the DETACHED_PROCESS flag. I suspect that it is
    only relevant when the calling process is a console app.

    CloseHandle(WriteHandle);
    {close our copy of Write handle - Child has its own copy now. It is important
    to close ours, otherwise ReadFile may not return when child closes its
    StdOutput - this is the mechanism by which the following loop detects the
    termination of the child process: it does not poll GetExitCodeProcess.

    The clue to this behaviour is in the 'Anonymous Pipes' topic of Win32.hlp - quote

    "To read from the pipe, a process uses the read handle in a call to the
    ReadFile function. When a write operation of any number of bytes completes,
    the ReadFile call returns. The ReadFile call also returns when all handles
    to the write end of the pipe have been closed or if any errors occur before
    the read operation completes normally."

    On this basis (and going somewhat beyond that stated above) I have assumed that
    ReadFile will return TRUE when a write is completed at the other end of the pipe
    and will return FALSE when the write handle is closed at the other end.

    I have also assumed that ReadFile will return when its output buffer is full
    regardless of the size of the write at the other end.

    I have tested all these assumptions as best I can (under NT 4)}

      while ReadFile(ReadHandle, ReadBuf, SizeOf(ReadBuf), BytesRead, nil) do begin
        {There are much more efficient ways of doing this: we don't really

            Inc(LineBufPtr);
            if LineBufPtr >= (SizeOf(LineBuf) - 1) then {line too long - force a break}

      terminated, so will wait for up to five seconds to give it a chance to
      terminate. If it has not done so after this time, then we will end
      up returning STILL_ACTIVE ($103)

      If you don't care about the exit code of the process, then you don't
      need this wait: having said that, unless the child process has a
      particularly longwinded cleanup routine, the wait will be very short
      in any event.
      I recommend you leave this wait in place unless you have an intimate
      understanding of the child process you are spawining and are sure you
      don't want to wait for it}

The Comp (computational) type is native to the Intel CPU and represents a 64-bit integer. A Comp is classified as a real, however, it does not behave like an ordinal type. Comp is maintained for backward compatibility only. Use the Int64  type for better performance.
