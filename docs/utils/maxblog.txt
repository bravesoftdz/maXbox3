 # EKON 14 Recap
by Sebastian, September 29th, 2010, Categories: Delphi, Delphi Prism, Mono, MonoDevelop

Right now I’m on my way back home from the Entwickler-Konferenz (EKON) 14 in
 Darmstadt, Germany. Jim is still there, but I have other duties so I left a day
  before the conference ends officially.

I had two sessions, the first yesterday was about Delphi Prism language specialties
 where I talked about cool features like class contracts and also interface
  delegation. Today I talked about multi platform development with Delphi Prism,
   concentrating on the apple platforms, both the Mac and iOS using Mono and
    MonoTouch for the iPhone/iPad.

I also sneaked into other sessions. There was a ‘how do I hack VCL programs’ session
 that really showed some interesting debugging, dumping and assembler-modification to
  crack a dongle protected native Delphi application as well as Holger Klemt talking
   about his personal experience with guys cracking is IBExpert software and what he
    did against that. Also Ray Konopka had a very interesting session about the
     Ribbon UI in general.

I especially enjoyed Max Kleiners talk about our PascalScript. Until today I didn’t
 knew he had built sort of a little IDE for it, called maxBox. It’s a scripting
  toolbox with a *lot* of scripatble functionality. He showed (beside other things)
   how to download a (free) mp3 file from the internet and directly played it from a
    little script – it was awesome (the demo, that is. Not the music, actually ;) ).
     maxBox, just like PascalScript that powers the IDE, is open source and you can
      get the sources from sourceforge. You can find more information about it here:
       Softwareschule.ch/Maxbox . So go and check it out, it also brings script
        debugging and syntax highlighting with it and really is a good start for a
         little scripting with pascal script. At this point I really like to say
          thanks to Max. Doing that for the purpose of teaching programming and open
           sourcing the tool is a nice gesture.

Next speaking opportunity for me is at the Embarcadero CodeRage 5 online conference
 where I have two sessions on Thursday next week. One is about LINQ with Delphi Prism
  and the other about Hydra, so join me there if you like to. It’s totally online, so
   no shoes? No shirt? No problem! ;)

Nick Hodges have done some really funny sessions about the codegear product line. Many jokes (including in the evenin by dinner (small bear :-) )). Also many excellent speakers was found at the ekon like marco cantu, thomas pfister, daniel wischnewski and jeroen pluimers. Sorry if i missed somebody. But for me the best session of Ekon was the session from Max Kleiner about Cryptography. Max THANK YOU!! If you have a chance to hear from max a session, try it.

I talked about:


Das berufliche Umfeld von Max Kleiner liegt im Bereich OOP, UML und Systemarchitektur, unter anderem als Trainer, Entwickler und Publizist. Seine Schwerpunkte sind IT-Security und Simulatoren, die die Power des Delphi-Compilers brauchen.
Als Dozent in einer FH und im Werkauftrag einer Firma sind auch Microcontroller und das Web of Things dazugekommen. Das im Jahr 2003 publizierte Buch "Patterns konkret" ist auch mit der Clean Code Initiative noch aktuell.
